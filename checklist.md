# PLAYNE Website Deployment Checklist

## Overview
Deploy PLAYNE website to Vercel with optimal static generation and Sanity CMS integration. Focus on minimal footprint and simple, reliable content update workflow.

## Strategy Decision: Full Rebuild vs ISR
**Chosen Approach:** Full rebuild on Sanity publish
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture with single webhook
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed consistency across all pages
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging and deployment history
- ‚úÖ Appropriate for 7-page site with moderate content updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2-3 minute delay for content updates (acceptable tradeoff)

### 1.3 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with required variables
- [ ] Document environment setup for deployment
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly typed
- [ ] Test environment variable loading in production build

---

## Phase 2: Vercel Deployment Setup ‚è≥

### 2.1 Vercel Project Configuration

- [ ] Test webhook triggers with sample content updates

### 3.2 Content Update Workflow
- [ ] Document content editor workflow (Sanity Studio ‚Üí Publish ‚Üí Auto-deploy)
- [ ] Set up notification system for successful deployments
- [ ] Create rollback procedure for failed deployments
- [ ] Test end-to-end content update process

### 3.3 Fallback Strategies
- [ ] Configure graceful handling of Sanity API failures
- [ ] Set up monitoring for webhook delivery failures

- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Sanity API usage and costs
- [ ] Set up error tracking and alerting

### 4.3 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all 7 pages load correctly
- [ ] Verify all Sanity content displays properly
- [ ] Test responsive design across devices
- [ ] Validate SEO metadata generation
- [ ] Test site-wide navigation functionality
- [ ] Verify form submissions work (Contact page)

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff ‚è≥

### 5.1 Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Document deployment process and configuration
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements
- [ ] Create content editor guide for Sanity Studio

### 5.2 Maintenance Procedures
- [ ] Document how to update dependencies
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Document scaling considerations
- [ ] Set up regular health checks

---

## Success Criteria

### Functionality Requirements
- [ ] All 7 pages render correctly with Sanity content
- [ ] Site-wide navigation works (keyboard/swipe)
- [ ] Contact form submissions function properly
- [ ] Events display dynamically from Sanity
- [ ] SEO metadata generates correctly for all pages
- [ ] Responsive design works across all devices

### Content Management
- [ ] Content editors can publish updates via Sanity Studio
- [ ] Site rebuilds automatically within 5 minutes of publish
- [ ] No manual intervention required for content updates
- [ ] Rollback capability for problematic content changes

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Production Environment (Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production

# Optional: For webhook authentication
SANITY_API_KEY=your-api-key
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions
1. **Sanity API Limits:** Monitor usage, implement caching
2. **Build Failures:** Set up monitoring and rollback procedures  
3. **Content Editor Errors:** Provide clear documentation and training
4. **Performance Degradation:** Regular monitoring and optimization
5. **Webhook Failures:** Manual deployment backup process
