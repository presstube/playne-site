ü§ì Pillars of Education


Playne‚Äôs Pillars of Education

Anatomy & Body Awareness
Wellness & Self-Care
Nutrition & Healthy Living
Financial Literacy
We often only learn about our bodies when something goes wrong. Playne classes teach whole-body awareness where students learn about anatomy, movement, and physical expression from head to toes that increases confidence and agility.
In a time of constant distractions, our programs focus on cultivating mindfulness about ourselves and the world around us. By traveling within, students learn more about how to manage their feelings to reduce stress and anxiety.
Nourishing our bodies starts with knowing what we need to feel our best. Learning about the building blocks of food we eat - how things grow, where our food comes from, and what we need to have a nutritious meal - is a vital part of creating a full life. 

By building a foundation of financial awareness, we design and nurture the vital decision-making skills that help students understand how to invest in themselves and plan for their futures.

Intro
Welcome to the PLAYNE Curriculum & Resource Guide 

Hi, I‚Äôm Shantell

(Picture 		picture 		picture		picture)
			
Who are you?

I draw, walk think breathe pause question feel reflect create move exist

And I want to learn more about the world we live in 
with you!



Who is this for? 

PLAYNE Education is for students and learners of all levels who are interested in engaging with the art of Shantell Martin to learn about whole-body wellbeing that fosters confidence, critical thinking, emotional resilience, and everyday readiness. Educators, families, and community leaders can use this guide in schools, after-school programs, and beyond.

How do I use it? 

The curriculum and resource guide is set up into four key learning sections (Anatomy, Wellness & Self Care, Nutrition, Financial Awareness), and each section is divided into three BUILDABLE learning groups (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced). You are welcome to do all the lessons in order, or choose which lesson is most interesting to you and your classroom. All that is needed to join the lessons is a pen or pencil, some paper, and yourself. 

What is in this guide? 

The guide has playful activities, projects, conversation starters, and practical resources rooted in art. Each lesson begins with a story about our main character, Shantell, and centers on a piece of her art. The lessons are designed to be 45-50 minutes long, can be done alone or in groups, and are made to be flexible. This can also be used as a guide to create dynamic projects, art classes, and programs that support self-discovery through the arts.

Where can I learn more? 

Additional resources, related activities, and helpful links are included at the end of each lesson. Learn more about PLAYNE at playne.art!

Drawing Our Way to Ourselves 
Lesson Series 1: Body Awareness

Source Dance Every Day, Buffalo, NY ABK Museum

Workshop: Shantell‚Äôs Body in Motion

Time: 45 min

Lesson goals: 
	‚Ä¢	Learn a basic series of exercises to warm-up the body 
	‚Ä¢	Discuss basic human anatomy - bones, skin, muscle, and the skeleton
	‚Ä¢	Thoughtfully observe a piece of art

Materials: Pen or pencils, paper

Introduction (to be read aloud by teacher or student volunteers): 

Meet Shantell! She is a curious and adventurous girl from London who draws all day long - on her clothes, bags, journals, friends, shoes, and even the street outside of her apartment. When she starts moving her pen she tries not to stop, and the lines curve, flow, and wander from her body through her hand, often feeling like they mirror the way she feels inside. 

One day while walking down the street and looking for something to draw on, Shantell tripped and stumbled. She landed safely, but realized that she‚Äôd  accidentally drawn a huge black dot on her clean white shirt! She didn‚Äôt understand how that happened - how did walking down the street suddenly lead to staining her clothes? She thought she had been paying attention, but somehow her whole body was impacted by one small action. 

Shantell stopped, took a deep breath, and realized something important: she knew a lot about lines, squiggles, and dots, but she didn‚Äôt know how to understand what was happening in her own body. She knew to drink tea when she was sick, or put on a bandaid when she cut her finger, but she didn‚Äôt know how her bones help her stand, how her muscles help her dance, or why her feet didn‚Äôt always do what she wanted! 

To try and figure out what was going on, she started to ask questions and draw the results, so she could learn more about herself using her pen and her paper. Now, it‚Äôs your turn to help her ‚Äî and yourself ‚Äî learn about the body, how it works, and how to take care of it. All you‚Äôll need to start is something to write with and a piece of paper.

5 mins		Introduction (to be read aloud by teacher or student volunteers): 

All grades: 

Shantell woke up one morning with a strange fluttering in her chest. As she got up and ready for school, she noticed that the fluttering feeling stayed there, as though butterflies had moved into her body and were having a little party. She shook out her hands and feet, but the feeling remained. As she got closer to school, the feeling started to move into her arms, and down her legs. ‚ÄúWhat could this be?‚Äù Shantell asked herself. Her mind started racing as she considered that this was part of having big feelings, which can be difficult, fun, exciting, etc. but she needed a way to understand and move through her big feelings. Then she remembered something she‚Äôd learned in class the previous week about ways to deal with anxiety and feelings of stress - deep breathing. Slowly, carefully, Shantell breathed in and out, in and out, until the butterfly sensation slowly started to disappear. Today, we are going to explore ways of managing big emotions with deep breathing.

5 mins		INTRODUCTION (Read aloud by instructor or student volunteers) 
One sunny afternoon while drawing in her sketchpad, young artist Shantell heard a familiar grumbling noise. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said out loud, ‚Äúmy stomach is trying to tell me something!‚Äù She was hungry. As she set her pen down, she started to wonder: what should I eat to help me feel strong, that would also give me energy to keep drawing? 
She picked her pen back up and started to draw foods - fruit, bread, eggs - and then followed the lines and swirls of her page to create pathways and journeys that the foods traveled to get to her plate. She drew a tomato plant on a rooftop, a school garden, and a map of food traveling through cities‚Äîfarms to stores, trucks to tables. ‚ÄúWait a minute,‚Äù she thought as she drew, ‚Äúwhere does my food come from before it gets to the store?‚Äù

The Future We Are We (2020)

5 mins		INTRODUCTION (Read aloud by instructor or student volunteers) 
‚ÄúThe future, we are we. To build, to grow, to know, to care, to say so.‚Äù The words and lines were flowing freely from Shantell‚Äôs sketchpad, as she thought about her future - where would she live as an older person? Would she still have the same friends? Where would she travel to? As her marker glided across the paper creating pathways, eyes, question marks - she started to write the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù again and again. But just as the line of the ‚Äòe‚Äô began its curl, her favorite marker ran out. Again. That‚Äôs when she looked around and realized how many supplies she‚Äôd gone through this month. She loved making art, but had she thought about how much it all cost?
Sitting back, she stared at the lines on her page, noticing how they twisted with certainty and exploration, concern and wonder, confusion and a little bit of messiness. 
‚ÄúWow this drawing is sort of like my art supply box right now. How could I plan out my supplies a little better‚Ä¶ and keep making things that are fun and beautiful?‚Äù

6/16/25

	‚Ä¢	Vern is looking for body-heavy pieces by Shantell that could be used in the lesson plan, will share with Leah
	‚Ä¢	Leah will streamline story, language in Lesson 1
	‚Ä¢	Create a loose lesson plan for the next pillar (mental health)
	‚Ä¢	Source anatomy image


Questions 6/8/25:

	‚Ä¢	Do you want the lesson to cover all four pillars? Or would it be best for the lesson to be a 4-part series that can be accessed at any point? E.g. ‚ÄúLet's do the SEL lesson for 4th graders today.‚Äù - Leah can decide what works
	‚Ä¢	Mission, Vision, Values, and Goals are good for grant applications and funders, but sort of overkill on websites. We can table the heavy content for backend notes, and keep the most streamlined content on the frontend.
	‚Ä¢	Media! Will these lessons be web-based? Videos? Downloadable worksheets? What is the vision for digital accessibility? - ideally on the web, also a physical item
