Introduction (to be read aloud by teacher or student volunteers): 

| Meet Shantell\! She is a curious and adventurous girl from London who draws all day long \- on her clothes, bags, journals, friends, shoes, and even the street outside of her apartment. When she starts moving her pen she tries not to stop, and the lines curve, flow, and wander from her body through her hand, often feeling like they mirror the way she feels inside.  |
| :---- |

One day while walking down the street and looking for something to draw on, Shantell tripped and stumbled, and her pen went flying out of her hand, breaking open across the sidewalk. The ink spilled onto the ground creating lines, waves, and shapes that made her think about a body with veins, muscles, and blood pumping to a heart. As her imagination continued to create an inky being filling the sidewalk, she thought about how her creativity flows just as easily from her hands and to the page, but how did her blood flow through her insides? What was she made up of, after all? 

Shantell stopped, took a deep breath, and realized something important: she knew a lot about lines, squiggles, and dots, but she didn’t know how to understand what was happening in her own body. She knew to drink tea when she was sick, or put on a bandaid when she cut her finger, but she didn’t know how her bones help her stand, how her muscles help her dance, or why her feet didn’t always do what she wanted\! 

To try and figure out what was going on, she started to ask questions and draw the results, so she could learn more about herself using her pen and her paper. Now, it’s your turn to help her — and yourself — learn about the body, how it works, and how to take care of it. All you’ll need to start is something to write with and a piece of paper. 

5 minutes 	Warm-up

Loosen the body through basic exercises: head rolls, shoulder rolls, forward/back bend, stretch arms overhead move your hips in a circle, twist from side to side, and jump in place while your limbs hang like a ragdoll. Modify as needed for different mobility levels. 

10 minutes	What do you see?

Look at *I’m Alive* by Shantell Martin for two minutes.

Group discussion questions: 

* What do you see?   
* What is in this image (words, people, places, things)?   
* What do you think it is made of/how big is it/where do you think it is? Is something happening?   
* Is there an emotion in this piece (sad, happy, scared, angry, excited)?   
* Is this a story?   
* How could this drawing be a song, poem, or rhythm? 

15 minutes	Are you, you?

* Take a look at this anatomy drawing. Think about where each part of your body is, and how it is connected.   
    
* Everyone stand up and take a look at your body. Really observe your skeleton: how it is put together, what is connected to what, and how it all flows from your head to your feet.   
    
* Get a pencil and paper. Without picking up your pencil or looking at the handout, draw a basic outline of your skeleton using one line. Don’t worry about complete accuracy, just try to include as much of your body as you can, from head to toe.  
    
* *If there’s more time:*  
  Once you have drawn yourself, pick a partner and sit across from them. Observe their skeleton\! And once more, without picking up your pencil, draw everything you can see about them on your paper.

15 minutes \- Who are we? 

* Get a fresh piece of paper  
    
* Make a new drawing, and this time you can lift your pencil as often as you like.   
    
* Draw your body again, and add other details to your body shape that make you *you*: curved lines showing how your body moves, and where your muscles start and end, and how your body looks in motion. You can also add letters, lines, circles, and shapes.  
    
* Some body parts to remember: Skull, neck, shoulder, arm, elbow, hand, finger, chest, hip, thigh, knee, shin, ankle, foot, toes.

5 minutes \- Wrap up

* Take a look at each other’s drawings. Questions to ask:   
  * What makes your skeleton drawings different from one another?   
  * How do some people move differently than others?   
  * What was surprising about drawing without looking at the paper?   
  * What did it feel like to draw someone else?  
  * Describe what makes your drawing *you.*

Additional Exercises

* **5 second art dance**: Stand up and move your body into the shape of one line or section of Shantell’s drawing, and hold it for five seconds at a time (teacher can count to 5). Try to make ten different shapes\!  
* **Figure drawing**: Pick one item in the classroom (a toy, plant, small furniture, art piece). Spend 5 minutes drawing what you see \- start with an outline, then fill it in with the details.  
* **Invisible portraits**: Sit across from a classmate, and in one minute, draw their face without looking at the paper or lifting your pencil.  
* **Drawing charades**: Have each student write a plant, person, or animal on a small piece of paper and put the papers in a large hat or bowl. Put a large board or paper at the front of the room, and invite one student at a time to pick a piece of paper and draw the item for the other students to guess.
