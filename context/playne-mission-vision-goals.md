**Mission:** 

PLAYNE uses creativity to teach the things we wish we learned in school â€” how to care for our bodies, understand our emotions, manage money, and find our voice. Through playful, practical lessons rooted in art, we give young people the space to explore *who they are* before being told who to be.

**Vision:** 

We believe every young person deserves the tools to thrive, not just in school, but in life. PLAYNE reimagines learning by putting curiosity, wellness, and self-discovery at the center. Through hands-on experiences in classrooms and communities, we help students gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.

### **Goals:**

**Teach Real-Life Skills Through Art**  
Use creativity as a way to explore topics like nutrition, wellness, anatomy, and personal finance in a relatable, age-appropriate way.

**Support Self-Discovery**  
Help students build a stronger sense of self by encouraging questions, reflection, and exploration of their personal voice and values.

**Make Learning Engaging and Multisensory**  
Design activities that blend drawing, movement, storytelling, and group discussion to activate the body, mind, and heart.

**Create Tools That Work in Any Space**  
Build flexible resources that educators, families, and community leaders can use in schools, after-school programs, and beyond.

**Help Students Feel Equipped for Life**  
Provide frameworks that foster confidence, critical thinking, emotional resilience, and everyday readiness \- qualities that endure long after the lesson concludes.
