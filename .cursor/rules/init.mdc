If there is a "checklist.md": 
- Always begin by reading "checklist.md" and orienting around it
- Always finalize by reading "checklist.md" marking complete items, and adding notes about hiccups and learnings

If there is no "checklist.md" don't worry about it, it just means there is no active structured mission underway.

Always read "architecture/pages-components-css.md" before tackling a new feature or embarking on a new initiative. Go with the grain of the current architecture. Don't introduce new and conflicting architectural decisions and patterns. Don't shoot from the hip. Measure twice, cut once.

Don't git commit for me. I'll handle that.

Don't run the dev server. I'll handle that.
