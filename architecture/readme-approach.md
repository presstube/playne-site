# README Approach

## Philosophy
The README should be a living document that grows with the project, remaining simple, concise, and accurate at all times. It serves as the single source of truth for developers (including future us) to understand the project setup and best practices.

## Content Strategy
- **Complete but not verbose** - Include everything needed, nothing more
- **Step-by-step accuracy** - Each instruction should work exactly as written
- **Developer-focused** - Written for developers who need to work on the project
- **Always current** - Update immediately when setup or practices change

## Structure Guidelines
1. **Quick Start** - Get running in under 5 minutes
2. **Architecture Overview** - High-level understanding of how things fit together
3. **Development Workflow** - Day-to-day development practices
4. **Deployment** - How to deploy and manage the live site
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Maintenance Approach
- Update README incrementally as each phase is completed
- Test all instructions on a fresh machine/environment
- Keep language clear and direct
- Use code blocks for exact commands
- Include expected outputs where helpful
- Remove outdated information immediately

## Quality Checks
- Can a new developer get the project running using only the README?
- Are all commands and file paths accurate?
- Is the architecture explanation clear and helpful?
- Are best practices clearly communicated?
